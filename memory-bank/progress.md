### Current Sprint
- ðŸ”„ Implementing comprehensive test suite
- ðŸ”„ Adding feature flags system
- ðŸ”„ Optimizing image processing pipeline

## Known Issues

### Bugs
1. **Memory Leak in Image Generation UI**
   - Memory usage increases over time when generating multiple images
   - Temporary workaround: Restart application after generating ~20 images

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling in API Service**
   - Some API errors are not properly caught and displayed
   - Sometimes results in generic error messages to users

3. **File Permission Issues in Storage Service**
   - Occasional permission issues when saving files
   - May require elevated permissions in some environments

### Limitations
1. **API Rate Limiting**
   - BFL API has rate limits that can affect heavy usage
   - No built-in rate limit management yet

2. **Large File Handling**
   - Training with very large datasets (>500MB) can be unstable
   - Memory constraints on image processing for large images

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Optimal experience in Chrome and Firefox
   - Some UI issues in Safari and older browsers

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architectural Evolution
1. **Initial Design**: Simple script-based approach with direct API calls
2. **First Refactor**: Class-based approach with basic separation
3. **Current Architecture**: Full service-oriented architecture with dependency injection

### UI Evolution
1. **Initial UI**: Basic Gradio interface with minimal styling
2. **Improved UI**: Enhanced UI with better layout and feedback
3. **Current UI**: Component-based architecture with inheritance from BaseUI

### Error Handling Evolution
1. **Initial Approach**: Basic try/except with generic messages
2. **Improved Approach**: Specific error types with more detailed messages
3. **Current Approach**: Centralized error handling with context and severity levels

### Future Architectural Decisions
1. **Potential Microservices**: Consider splitting into smaller services for scalability
2. **API Gateway**: Potential addition of API gateway for better security and rate limiting
3. **State Management**: Improved state management for more complex workflows
