# FLUX-Pro-Finetuning-UI Active Context

## Current Work Focus

As of May 14, 2025, the primary focus is on:

1. **Implementing comprehensive test suite** for all services
2. **Adding feature flags** for experimental features 
3. **Optimizing the image processing pipeline**
4. **Fixing identified bugs** in the memory handling and API service

## Recent Changes

### Refactoring Completion (April 2025)
- Service-oriented architecture plan created and implemented
- Core services layer implemented (ConfigService, APIService, StorageService, ValidationService)
- Business services layer implemented (ModelService, FinetuningService, InferenceService)
- UI components refactored to use services
- Documentation consolidated into memory-bank system

### Infrastructure Updates (May 2025)
- Added EnvManager module for centralized environment variable handling with dotenv support
- Implemented type-safe environment variable access methods (get_bool, get_int, get_float, get_list)
- Added test suite for environment variable management

### Dependency Updates
- Gradio updated to version 5.32.0 (May 14, 2025)
- NumPy updated to version 2.3.0 (May 14, 2025)
- Pillow updated to version 11.2.0 (May 14, 2025)
- Requests updated to version 2.33.0 (May 14, 2025)
- Python-dotenv verified at version 1.0.1 (May 14, 2025)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Implement comprehensive test suite for all services
2. Add feature flags for experimental features
3. Optimize image processing pipeline

### Feature Development Queue
1. Add support for image prompts in finetuning
2. Implement batch image generation
3. Add model comparison tool
4. Create dashboard for monitoring finetuning jobs
5. Implement user authentication and model sharing

### Bug Fixes
1. Fix memory leak in image generation UI
2. Address inconsistent error handling in API service
3. Resolve file permission issues in storage service

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Service Container Implementation**: We've chosen a lazy-loading approach for service initialization to optimize memory usage. Services are initialized only when they're needed.
2. **Error Handling Strategy**: We're using specific exception types for different error categories (ConfigError, APIError, StorageError, ValidationError) to provide more meaningful error messages.
3. **UI Component Design**: UI components are designed to be self-contained, with business logic delegated to services. This maintains a clean separation of concerns.

### Technical Debt Considerations
1. **Validation Logic**: Current validation approach needs refactoring to use schema validation for consistency.
2. **Error Messages**: Improving error messages for better user experience is planned.
3. **Logging System**: Need to add consistent logging throughout the application.
4. **Documentation**: Creating documentation for extending the system is needed.

### Performance Considerations
1. **Caching Strategy**: Implementing caching for API responses to reduce latency and API calls.
2. **Image Optimization**: Current image loading and processing needs optimization.
3. **Memory Management**: Reducing memory usage during finetuning operations.
4. **UI Performance**: Implementing lazy loading for UI components to improve initial load times.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Module Boundaries**: Keep clear boundaries between service layers
- **File Size Limits**: Keep files under 500 lines; split into modules if approaching limit
- **Import Organization**: Use consistent import ordering with isort
- **Type Hints**: Use Python type hints throughout the codebase

### UI Design Patterns
- **Consistent Styling**: All UI components should inherit from BaseUI for consistent styling
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Hide advanced options behind expandable sections
- **Feedback**: Provide clear feedback for long-running operations
- **Validation**: Validate inputs client-side where possible, with server-side validation as backup

### API Usage Patterns
- **Retry Logic**: Use exponential backoff for API retries
- **Error Handling**: Parse API errors to provide meaningful messages
- **Caching**: Cache stable data like model lists to reduce API calls

### Environment Variable Patterns
- **Centralized Access**: Use EnvManager for all environment variable access
- **Type-Safe Getters**: Use type-specific getters (get_bool, get_int) to avoid conversion issues
- **Default Values**: Always provide sensible defaults for environment variables
- **.env Files**: Use .env files for local development, actual environment variables for production

## Project Insights and Learnings

### Architectural Insights
- The service-oriented architecture has improved code organization and testability
- Dependency injection has made unit testing significantly easier
- Separation of UI from business logic has improved maintainability

### Technical Challenges
- Managing state in the Gradio UI requires careful consideration
- Balancing memory usage and performance for image operations
- Handling asynchronous API calls with proper error handling

### Future Directions
- The architecture supports potential expansion to additional model types
- The UI framework could be extended to support mobile interfaces
- Authentication and multi-user support could be added in the future
