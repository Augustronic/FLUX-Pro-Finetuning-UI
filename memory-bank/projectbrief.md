# FLUX-Pro-Finetuning-UI Project Brief

## Overview

FLUX-Pro-Finetuning-UI is a professional interface for model finetuning and image generation built on a service-oriented architecture. The system provides a robust framework for training and using finetuned AI models through a clean, intuitive Gradio-based UI.

## Purpose

The project aims to create a comprehensive solution that enables users to:
- Finetune AI models using various methods and parameters
- Generate images using finetuned models
- Manage and organize multiple models
- Track finetuning jobs and their progress

## Core Requirements

1. **Robust Architecture**: A service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI components for model finetuning and image generation
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed context
4. **Validation**: Extensive input validation to ensure correct operation
5. **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration system supporting multiple environments
6. **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
7. **Feature Toggling**: Feature flags for managing complexity and phased releases

## Key Features

1. **Model Finetuning**
   - Support for multiple finetuning modes (general, character, style, product)
   - Configurable learning parameters
   - Progress tracking
   - Model management

2. **Image Generation**
   - Multiple generation endpoints
   - Parameter control
   - Results handling and display

3. **Model Management**
   - Model browsing and selection
   - Model details viewing
   - Model refreshing

## Technical Approach

The system follows these architectural principles:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a clear, focused responsibility
- **Dependency Injection**: Components receive their dependencies rather than creating them
- **Lazy Loading**: Services are initialized only when needed to reduce memory usage
- **Modularity**: The system is composed of small, focused modules
- **Feature Flags**: Features can be conditionally enabled or disabled

## Success Criteria

The project will be successful if it:
1. Provides a reliable system for finetuning AI models
2. Offers an intuitive interface accessible to non-technical users
3. Handles errors gracefully with meaningful feedback
4. Supports expandability for future features
5. Maintains clear separation of concerns for maintainability
